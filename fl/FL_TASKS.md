## Implementation Plan

The federated learning system is designed with a modular architecture to separate concerns and enable easy testing and extension. The main components are:

1. **Client Module**: Handles local training and blockchain communication.
2. **Server Module**: Manages rounds, client selection, and model aggregation.
3. **Defense Module**: Implements Byzantine-robust aggregation mechanisms.
4. **Integration Layer**: Connects FL components with blockchain and IPFS.
5. **Experiment Framework**: Provides tools for evaluating different scenarios.

The implementation follows a test-driven development approach where tests are written before implementation. Integration with blockchain uses Foundry for contract deployment and interaction. Model parameter storage utilizes IPFS for decentralized and content-addressable storage.

Key security features include the Krum aggregation mechanism to defend against Byzantine attacks, model verification on blockchain, and optimistic rollup for efficient verification.

The system will be evaluated on various datasets with different attack scenarios to demonstrate its effectiveness in protecting against poisoning attacks while maintaining model accuracy and convergence.
